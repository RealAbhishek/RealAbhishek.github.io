I have created and written many blogs in last 12 years, since I first got my hands on a computer and familiarized myself with internet; but I never incorporated writing a blog in my life as a habit.
I work for a Software company as a Developer (actually, officially my designation is "Software Engineer Manage - II", but I prefer to think of myself as an Engineer or a Develper. I work with 13 people, and 10 of them are hired by me and I have worked hard to train them and let them know whatever I know. Now, I think I learn from them more than I teach/train.

So, I am creating this blog thinking that I would use it to put those small or big lessons I learn, either from my team or in the process of some discussion and brainstorming.
